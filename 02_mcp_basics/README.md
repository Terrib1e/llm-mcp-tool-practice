# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Basics

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables seamless integration between AI applications and data sources. It provides a standardized way for language models to securely access and interact with various tools and data sources.

## What is MCP?

MCP allows:
- **Secure Data Access**: Connect LLMs to databases, APIs, and file systems
- **Tool Integration**: Execute functions and tools through a standardized interface
- **Context Sharing**: Provide rich context to LLMs from various sources
- **Extensibility**: Build custom integrations and tools

## Key Components

### 1. MCP Server
- Hosts tools and resources
- Implements the MCP protocol
- Handles client requests
- Manages security and permissions

### 2. MCP Client
- Connects to MCP servers
- Sends requests for tools and resources
- Integrates with LLM applications
- Handles responses and errors

### 3. Protocol Messages
- **Initialization**: Establish connection and capabilities
- **Resource Discovery**: List available resources and tools
- **Tool Execution**: Call tools with parameters
- **Resource Access**: Read and write resources
